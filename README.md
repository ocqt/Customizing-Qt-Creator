# Customizing-Qt-Creator

Files used in the OC Qt/QML presentation on Customizing QtCreator.

## Getting Started

The Customizing_QtCreator.pptx slideshow is the slide deck from the presentation.
The Wizards.zip file is a collection of QtCreator wizards and customizations to default wizards.

### Prerequisites

To use the wizards, you must first install Qt Creator.  These wizards were tested with Qt Creator 4.1 and 4.2 without issues. Future changes may break them.

### Installing

To install the wizards, you will extract them and copy them into your Qt Creator's template folders. The location depends on your installation of Qt Creator.

Typical locations of the Qt Creator wizards folder: 
Windows: C:\Qt\Tools\QtCreator\share\qtcreator\templates\wizards
Ubuntu: /opt/Qt\tools\qtcreator\share\qtcreator\templates\wizards
